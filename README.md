# ThinkPrototype

This is a preliminary software prototype that I created as part of my submission to the MIT Think competition in 2019. 

I used Android Studio to create this prototype; the prototype helped me to improve my proposal and simplify my goals. 

The research proposal was one of about a dozen in the nation to receive semifinalist status in the MIT Think competition.
